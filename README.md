### Art Piece 1

Aaron Koblin created an awesome visualization of Amsterdam SMS messages around the times of New Years Eve. If you follow the link you can see buildings are "created" as SMS messages begin to be sent. I enjoyed this piece because I was surprised he was able to get SMS data legally (even though I'm sure it was anonymous) which I thought was interesting and that the data showed elevation to make the piece come off the page. Additionally, I'm actually going to Amsterdam soon so it was exciting to see such a cool representation of the city.

### Art Piece 2

Pitch Interactive took annual Flu season data and plotted it to show how difficult it is for doctors and staff to predict medical supply needs. I was drawn to this piece because while it has a pleasant look, the message behind it is interesting. Furthermore, in light of increasing outbreaks of older diseases in places like Seattle due to the Anti-Vax movement the piece seems even more relevant now.
